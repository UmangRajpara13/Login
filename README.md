This Application is made for using NoSql based Database for Flask Login.
Since all Session based Login systems are only available for SQL databases(like SQLAlchemy).
The code Works out-of-box but ofcourse will require modification as per one's need.
A small implementation using boto3 is available in this repo, which connects to AWS Dynamodb

To run the application

create virtual environment and activate

>pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

then

>python3 application.py


Happy Coding!
